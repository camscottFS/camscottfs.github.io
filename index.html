            <p class="about">Hello! My name is Cameron, but you can call me Cam. I'm currently enrolled at Full Sail University pursuing my Bachelor's of Science degree in Web Design & Development and I'm a PC gamer. I firmly enjoy front-end web development and I'm currently working to broaden my entire skillset, especially in terms of back-end development. I look forward to the day I graduate from Full Sail, and I'm excited to continue learning new innovative ways to create an amazing web experience.</p>

            <h2 class="componenth2">Seemless HTML5 Video</h2>
            <h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
            <p>After researching and viewing websites that have this I found it very useful and interesting. Inserting HTML5 Video and styling it with CSS to make it "seemless" could make the webpage look a lot better rather than using some sort of stationary image. I hope to learn ways to make the video appear as if it's not a video. An example of an HTML5 Video that was styled with CSS to appear seemless can be viewed <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/legion/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD</h3>
            <p>I've used videos in the past but never in this type of way. When visiting Blizzard's webpage for World of Warcraft: Legion I saw that Illidan was animated, so I inspected the page and found out that it was a video. It looked extremely good so I want to replicate it when necessary/useful in my WDD career.</p>
            <h3>How I might build this</h3>
            	<ol>
                	<li>Create the component as a <span class="code"><span><</span>div<span>></span></span></li>
                    <li>Create the video by using <span class="code"><span><</span>video<span>></span></span></li>
                    <li>Specify <span class="code"><span><</span>video loop autoplay preload="auto"<span>></span></span> to make the video loop and automatically play onload</li>
                    <li class="last">Use CSS to style and integrate the video into the page and make it appear as if it's not a video</li>
                </ol>
            	<h3>Style Guide</h3>
            	<ul>
                	<li>Font is completely custom</li>
                </ul>

        	<img class="componentimg" src="images/reponsivenav.png" alt="responsive navigation" />
            <h2 class="componenth2">Responsive Navigation Bar</h2>
            <h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
             <p>Responsive Navigation is important now-a-days because a lot of people view websites from their mobile device as well as their desktop/laptop. It doesn't matter whether it's done in JavaScript, CSS, or another way, but it has to be implemented if you want your website to meet the current industry standards. A lot of people are on the move so your website should be responsive! I'm looking forward to practicing CSS-specific ways to create a responsive navigation bar.</p>            
             <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD</h3>
             <p>I researched and learned simple ways to create a reponsive navigation bar with both JavaScript and CSS when I took Designing for Web Standards II. I intend to research and learn more ways of creating a responsive navigation bar with less code.</p>
             <h3>How I might build this</h3>
            	<ol>
                	<li>Create the component as a <span class="code"><span><</span>section<span>></span></span></li>
                    <li>Design the navigation bar using CSS such as <span class="code"><span>{ </span>display: inline;<span> }</span></span></li>
                    <li>Use media queries to change how the navi bar looks when viewed by certain sizes <span class="code">@media (min-width: 480px) { }</span></li>
                </ol>

            <h2 class="componenth2">JavaScript Progress Animations</h2>
            <h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
             <p>I'm using this for one of my current side projects and I think it's fantastic. I mainly chose this component because it is somewhat advanced. I also chose it so that I could expand my knowledge with jQuery and JavaScript. I will continue to practice different JavaScript transition and animation effects.</p>
            <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD</h3>
             <p>Programming for Web Applications II definitely opened my eyes into the world of back-end programming. I learned a lot of different tactics and uses for jQuery especially. This class opened my eyes more with JavaScript, so I definitely want to learn more, especially since it's used all the time.</p>
             <h3>How I might build this</h3>
            	<ol>
                	<li>Add appropriate JS file to HTML</li>
                    <li>Specify compontent as <span class="code"><span><</span>div class="progressbar" data-animate="false"></li>
                    <li>Add another div as <span class="code"><span><</span>div class="circle  data-percent="0"></span></li>
                    <li>Specify <span class="code">data-percent="0"</span> as whatever percentage you desire from 0-100</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Style Guide</h3>
            	<ul>
                	<li>Font appears to be Nota Normal</li>
                    <li>Gradients are used</li>

        	<img class="componentimg" src="images/footer.png" alt="footer" />
            <h2 class="componenth2">Advanced Footer</h2>
            <h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
             <p>Footers are pretty basic right? Well, in most cases they aren't. Now, most websites have intergrated icons for Twitter, Facebook, etc or another mini navigation along with the basic Copyright &copy 2016 stuff. This month I will practice different techniques to make a jazzy footer that's hooked up with a bunch of useful things.</p>
            <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD</h3>
             <p>Pretty much everyone knows how to add a footer to a page. Some don't know how to make the footer responsive and add other useful things such as icons for social media. This month and going forward I will dwell on this and figure out different things to add to the footer as well as social media icons that make the footer look better.</p>
             <h3>How I might build this</h3>
            	<ol>
                	<li>Start by specifying <span class="code"><span><</span>footer<span>></span></span></li>
                    <li>Insert your usual Copyright <span class="code"><span>&</span>copy</span> 2016</li>
                    <li>Add social media icons such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube etc as <span class="code"><span><</span>i<span>></span></span></span> like this:
           			<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="code"><span><</span><span>i</span> class="flaticon-youtube33"></span></span> <span class="code"><span><</span><span>i</span> class="flaticon-twitter39"></span></span> <span class="code"><span><</span><span>i</span> class="flaticon-facebook45"></span></span>
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <br>
                    <li>Style social media icons, any other code, and footer to look good and be responsive</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Style Guide</h3>
            	<ul>
                	<li>Font appears to be Uniman Medium</li>
                    <li>Color: #619644</li>
                    <li>Texture used for background</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
             <p>I haven't used featured lists that much currently, so creating this component will help give me an understanding of how they're built.</h3>
             <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD</h3>
             <p>I've taken both the HTML/CSS classes at Full Sail so far, so it gave me an edge when creating this component, and I will continue to broaden my skillset with this.</p>
