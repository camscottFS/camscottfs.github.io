            <p class="about">Hello! My name is Cameron, but you can call me Cam. I'm currently enrolled at Full Sail University pursuing my Bachelor's of Science degree in Web Design & Development and I'm a PC gamer. I firmly enjoy front-end web development and I'm currently working to broaden my entire skillset, especially in terms of back-end development. I look forward to the day I graduate from Full Sail, and I'm excited to continue learning new innovative ways to create an amazing web experience.</p>

            <h2 class="componenth2">Seemless HTML5 Video</h2>
            <h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
            <p>After researching and viewing websites that have this I found it very useful and interesting. Inserting HTML5 Video and styling it with CSS to make it "seemless" could make the webpage look a lot better rather than using some sort of stationary image. I hope to learn ways to make the video appear as if it's not a video. An example of an HTML5 Video that was styled with CSS to appear seemless can be viewed <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/legion/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD</h3>
            <p>I've used videos in the past but never in this type of way. When visiting Blizzard's webpage for World of Warcraft: Legion I saw that Illidan was animated, so I inspected the page and found out that it was a video. It looked extremely good so I want to replicate it when necessary/useful in my WDD career.</p>
            <h3>How I might build this</h3>
            	<ol>
                	<li>Create the component as a <span class="code"><span><</span>div<span>></span></span></li>
                    <li>Create the video by using <span class="code"><span><</span>video<span>></span></span></li>
                    <li>Specify <span class="code"><span><</span>video loop autoplay preload="auto"<span>></span></span> to make the video loop and automatically play onload</li>
                    <li>Use CSS to style and integrate the video into the page and make it appear as if it's not a video</li>
                </ol>

            <h2 class="componenth2">Responsive Navigation Bar</h2>
            <h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
             <p>Responsive Navigation is important now-a-days because a lot of people view websites from their mobile device as well as their desktop/laptop. It doesn't matter whether it's done in JavaScript, CSS, or another way, but it has to be implemented if you want your website to meet the current industry standards. A lot of people are on the move so your website should be responsive! I'm looking forward to practicing CSS-specific ways to create a responsive navigation bar.</p>            
             <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD</h3>
             <p>I researched and learned simple ways to create a reponsive navigation bar with both JavaScript and CSS when I took Designing for Web Standards II. I intend to research and learn more ways of creating a responsive navigation bar with less code.</p>
             <h3>How I might build this</h3>
            	<ol>
                	<li>Create the component as a <span class="code"><span><</span>section<span>></span></span></li>
                    <li>Design the navigation bar using CSS such as <span class="code"><span>{ </span>display: inline;<span> }</span></span></li>
                    <li>Use media queries to change how the navi bar looks when viewed by certain sizes <span class="code">@media (min-width: 480px) { }</span></li>
                </ol>

            <h2 class="componenth2">JavaScript Progress Animations</h2>
            <h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
             <p>I'm using this for one of my current side projects and I think it's fantastic. I mainly chose this component because it is somewhat advanced. I also chose it so that I could expand my knowledge with jQuery and JavaScript. I will continue to practice different JavaScript transition and animation effects.</p>
            <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD</h3>
             <p>Programming for Web Applications II definitely opened my eyes into the world of back-end programming. I learned a lot of different tactics and uses for jQuery especially. This class opened my eyes more with JavaScript, so I definitely want to learn more, especially since it's used all the time.</p>
             <h3>How I might build this</h3>
            	<ol>
                	<li>Add appropriate JS file to HTML</li>
                    <li>Specify compontent as <span class="code"><span><</span>div class="progressbar" data-animate="false"></li>
                    <li>Add another div as <span class="code"><span><</span>div class="circle  data-percent="0"></span></li>
                    <li>Specify <span class="code">data-percent="0"</span> as whatever percentage you desire from 0-100</li>
                </ol>

        	<img class="componentimg" src="images/footer.png" alt="footer" />
            <h2 class="componenth2">Advanced Footer</h2>
            <h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
             <p>Footers are pretty basic right? Well, in most cases they aren't. Now, most websites have intergrated icons for Twitter, Facebook, etc or another mini navigation along with the basic Copyright &copy 2016 stuff. This month I will practice different techniques to make a jazzy footer that's hooked up with a bunch of useful things.</p>
            <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD</h3>
             <p>Pretty much everyone knows how to add a footer to a page. Some don't know how to make the footer responsive and add other useful things such as icons for social media. This month and going forward I will dwell on this and figure out different things to add to the footer as well as social media icons that make the footer look better.</p>
             <h3>How I might build this</h3>
            	<ol>
                	<li>Start by specifying <span class="code"><span><</span>footer<span>></span></span></li>
                    <li>Insert your usual Copyright <span class="code"><span>&</span>copy</span> 2016</li>
                    <li>Add social media icons such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube etc as <span class="code"><span><</span>i<span>></span></span></span> like this:
           			<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="code"><span><</span><span>i</span> class="flaticon-youtube33"></span></span> <span class="code"><span><</span><span>i</span> class="flaticon-twitter39"></span></span> <span class="code"><span><</span><span>i</span> class="flaticon-facebook45"></span></span>
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <br>
                    <li>Style social media icons, any other code, and footer to look good and be responsive</li>
                </ol>

        	<img class="componentimg" src="images/rss.png" alt="rss" />
            <h2 class="componenth2">PHP RSS Feed</h2>
            <h3>What I hope to practice and/or learn</h3>
             <p>No database required. Straight PHP code that pulls information from an rss link and displays it for you, whichever variables you have selected. I've done this for Announcements posted on my Xenforo forum already. I pulled the text, date, title, author and displayed it with print. The goal this month will be to expand my knowledge and try different types of rss feeds.</p>
            <h3>How this relates to what I have/will learn in WDD</h3>
             <p>I haven't learned any PHP from any classes at Full Sail University yet, but I know there we will be classes on it in the future. This works to my advantage because everything I know about PHP currently I learned on my own. As I'm very uncomfortable with back-end programming at the moment this will definitely take the edge off a little bit.</p>
             <h3>How I might build this</h3>
            	<ol>
                	<li>Create the component with a <span class="code"><span><</span>div<span>></span></span></li>
                	<li>Find the rss feed link</li>
                    <li>Specify <span class="code">$feed_url</span> and <span class="code">$xml_data</span></li>
                    <li>Add variables as needed such as <span class="code">$e_title = (string)$ritem->title; </span></li>
                    <li>You could display it (simply) like this: <span class="code">print "$e_title" \n";</span></li>
                    <li>Continue to write PHP as needed</li>
                </ol>
